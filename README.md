# Simple DAIFaucet

Getting DAI test tokens on Kovan

Simple interface for changing ETH to DAI with the help of Uniswap

Kovan deployment: 0x786e3c83cd270414649079A758Ad92f961EDdA0A

Usage (Kovan only):

1. Send ether to the DAIFaucet smart contract: 0x786e3c83cd270414649079A758Ad92f961EDdA0A

be sure that the gas limit is high enough, like 300.000 because it is a contract call

2. Changed DAI token will be available on your address. We use DAI token with address (on Kovan) : 0x4F96Fe3b7A6Cf9725f59d353F723c1bDb64CA6Aa

3. Exchange rate depends on Uniswap, it can be far from the mainnet exchange rates

Kovan test token only, do not use it in production !
